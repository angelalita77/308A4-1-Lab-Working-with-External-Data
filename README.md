# 308A4-1-Lab-Working-with-External-Data

This lab was created with CodeSandbox

### Introduction

This graded assignment challenges you to create an interactive application using data from an external Application Programming Interface (API). In order to accomplish this task, you will employ the tools and techniques you have learned thus far, including fetch, Axios, and async/await syntax.

### Objectives

Request data from an external API using fetch and Axios.
Create an interactive, dynamic webpage that serves content from an external API.
Use async/await and Promises to create synchronous logic in asynchronous actions.
Using fetch or Axios, POST data to and DELETE data from an external API.

- This will be an API for a breed of cats.
- The different breeds will be placed in the dropdown (which is now empty).
- Once the user clicks the "Get Favorites" button, the user should be able to select a breed of cats.
- Images of that breed will be displayed on the website.
- Under the images is information about that breed of cat.
